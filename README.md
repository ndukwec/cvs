# CVS Accounts Display App
To run this application do the following: 

`cd into the directory, run npm install
`

`open two terminal windows:
`

`first run: npm run server in the first window
`

`then run: ng serve in the second window
`

go to http://localhost:4200/

Inside the server directory is our `database.json` file which
has the data we'd like to come from the server.
